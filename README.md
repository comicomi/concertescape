# concertescape

This application returns top 5 results for the user's input (name of the performer whose concert the user would like to go to and current location of the user). Results are defined as data that provides information about the event queried performer will participate and the cheapest round trip the user could book in order to visit that event. 
The APIs used for getting relevant data are the following:
1. SeatGeek Platform API - to get events data;
2. QPX Express API - to get flights data.
